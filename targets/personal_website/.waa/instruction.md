Please make a personal website for me.
My name is John, I like programming and making games.
I love programming languages like Rust and TypeScript.
I love formalisms and programming language theory.
I am capable of making video games in Unity and Unreal.
I have made a VR game of Ping Pong purely in C++.
I enjoy making visually cool looking things like special effects.
In the personal website, please make it look visually cool and algorithmic using CSS effects.

The main website should be in `index.html`.
There should be no API test as this website will be purely static.
There is already UI tests in tests/ui.test.js, please run these when you have the files ready.
If you want to add more tests, please create other files.
